#### Component Hierarchy

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app.

```

|__ assets/
      |__ data-tests
      |__ fonts
      |__ graphics
      |__ images

#### Component Breakdown

> Use this section to go into further depth regarding your components, including breaking down the components as stateless or stateful, and considering the passing of data between those components.

| Component  |    Type    | state | props | Description                                                       |
| :--------: | :--------: | :---: | :---: | :---------------------------------------------------------------- |

#### Component Estimates

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above.
>
> Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe.

| Task       | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ---------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Header     |    H     |     3 hrs      |     0 hrs     |     TBD     |
| Navegation |    H     |     4 hrs      |     0 hrs     |     TBD     |
| Search     |    H     |     4 hrs      |     0 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TV Shows   |    H     |     6 hrs      |     0 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TV Show    |    H     |     8 hrs      |     0 hrs     |     TBD     |
| About      |    L     |     3 hrs      |     0 hrs     |     TBD     |
| Footer     |    H     |     3 hrs      |     0 hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL      |          |     31 hrs     |     3 hrs     |     TBD     |

| Capitalize | _Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur._ |
